      <h1>Lindsay G.</h1>
        <p>
        Before entering the CATP, I had almost no design experience. I majored in Art Studio the first time I went to college and I hated it. That was a long time ago, so I didn't touch a computer for about 12 years after that. However, I have really grown to love graphic design and the wonderful instructors who have breathed new life into my interest and education. </p>
        <p>
          For the future, I definitely want to get my Associates Degree. After that, I either want to pursue more higher education in the Design/Business field, or try to get a well-paying job in graphic design and then maybe they'll pay for more school...<b>then</b> make my own business and wake up at 12pm everyday. Or get into the Medical Marijuana Industry.</p>
